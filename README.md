# TrainingProject
Fruit360 Dataset â€“ Classification with ResNet, Detection with YOLO, and Image Generation with GAN This project classifies fruits using a ResNet-based CNN, detects them with YOLOv8, and generates realistic fruit images using a GAN model.

### Prerequisites

* **Python:** Ensure you have Python installed. The notebook uses Python 3.11.13.
* **Jupyter:** You will need Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to open and run the `.ipynb` file.
* **Dependencies:** The following libraries are imported and are required to run the code:
    * numpy
    * pandas
    * matplotlib
    * seaborn
    * tensorflow
    * keras

   - Download Fruits360 Dataset from Kaggle:  
     https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moltean/fruits  
   - Place it in a `data/` folder.

### How to Run the Code

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/asmaa844/TrainingProject.git>
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
